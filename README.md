Panel Data Analysis on Wellbeing before and after COVID-19
Wellbeing is a crucial ‘indicator’ for policymakers to see what factors influence an individual’s wellbeing as they can utilise this information to help improve the life quality of citizens, similarly suggested by Grajek et al. (2021). It is particularly important to focus on how individuals’ wellbeing level (referred to as utility units throughout our analysis) changes before and after the pandemic to see the impact it had on mental health. It has been speculated by O’Connor et al. (2020) that there are likely to be profound and long-lasting changes to our society; we already see changes in individual behaviours through increased usage of social media post-pandemic (Liu H et al, 2021). Despite the belief that there are a plethora of reasons which can generate a change in ones wellbeing, interpretation of coefficients will focus on what we believe are the main drivers that generally determine an individual’s mental health to find a best-fit model, shown as follows: net income (linc), education (educ), and job-status (jobstatus).
